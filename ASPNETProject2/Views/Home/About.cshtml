    <h3>Real People, Real Reviews.</h3>
    <p>
        We were inspired to start this site because we both come from a construction background and felt that our are needed a place to go to see real
        reviews from real people who hired local contractors.  We want real, honest reviews of work that was done that will help potential customers
        decide which contractor they want to hire.  If you've had good, bad or ugly experience, we want to know! (Though we do prefer the good ones!)
